# Atheris: The escape from Odoo you had always been waiting

This project is a built over the most modern framework out there for the web ecosystem, Senjor, this is the second project built by the Senjor creator, so as a summary let's tell what Senjor is:

## Senjor: What is?
Senjor is a framework built over Django, ReactJS, Socket.IO, GraphQL, Daphne for ASGI, and natively integrated with OAuth backend like Keycloak.

## Why Atheris?
Atheris leverages all Senjor capabilities which in fact it does reduces the amount of features needed to built an RTC backend. Here are the benefits for devs of using Atheris :
1. We don't handle directly authorization, instead Keycloak or your custom OAuth provider does.
2. We don't use too much code just barely some custom controller logic, and model schema specifications, most of the code is focused on what we need.
3. we don't hire a designer team for building interface, instead our dear Google, IBM, and many hire them for us and share their design system, so by using React (from Meta) we can just integrate quickly with many custom themes.
4. We don't waste time trying to do something our way when there is a faster way, but rather we focus on PEP principles, explicit is better than implicit and all of that (things that Odoo never tried to do).
5. We don't reject odoo, you're still able to be masochist and use Odoo Web Library and Odoo principles to extend Atheris as well (Are you that crazy?)

## Roadmap
1. Create the core modules which includes:
    1. Theming of the frontend allowing multiple themes like Google Material, IBM wtv theme and the others xD
    2. Internationalization with react-i18n
    3.

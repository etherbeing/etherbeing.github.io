## 🧩 Key Projects

### 🔹 [CVE Forge (Still Private this is a work in progress)](https://github.com/etherbeing/CVE-Forge)
Python-based framework for building CVEs and research tools. Includes offline `pip` caching and virtualenv isolation. Designed for practical use, Metasploit-style — but easier and more pythonic.

### 🔹 TFProtocol
A full-stack communication protocol designed on top of TCP/UDP for custom application-level messaging. Built from scratch. [TFProtocol Github Link](https://github.com/GoDjango-Development/tfprotocol)
